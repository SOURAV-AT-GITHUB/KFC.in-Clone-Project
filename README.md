Fast Food Chain Website - KFC.in
Welcome to the KFC.in frontend project! This application is a React-based web app designed to provide a seamless experience for browsing the KFC menu, adding items to the cart, and managing your order. The UI is built using React and ChakraUI, ensuring a modern, responsive design.

Project Overview
The KFC.in project is a fast-food chain website where users can explore various menu categories, view offers, and manage their cart. The website features a full-screen animation on first load, a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices, and a dynamic cart system.

Key Features
Full-Screen Animation: On the initial load, a full-screen animation with three red bars appearing from the top and hiding to the bottom will be displayed.
Homepage: Includes a navigation bar, category section, offers, deals, and footer.
Menu Page: Products are categorized and displayed with a responsive layout. The left sidebar lists categories, and the right side shows products. On small screens, the sidebar moves to the top with horizontal scrolling.
Product Categories: Clickable categories that jump to the respective section.
Cart Functionality: Users can add products to the cart, which updates the total amount in real-time. Cart modification is supported with real-time updates to the total value.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive with a drawer menu for smaller screens, featuring links to the home and menu pages. The total cart value is displayed outside the drawer.
